        description : "Civil Technology is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. It is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipal or urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering, surveying, Architecture, and construction engineering. Civil engineering takes place on all levels: in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international",

        description : "Computer technology is a technology that instead of building a physical machine for each application builds a logical or virtual machine. The logical machine is general purpose and can be put to any specific problem. Each specific problem is implemented in the logical machine by software. Software is thus the most important element of computer technology. Software enables the mass production of cheap mass-produced physical machines that can be turned to any application, rather than building expensive special-purpose hardware.",

The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century after commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. It now covers a range of subtopics including power, electronics, control systems, signal processing and telecommunications. Electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with large-scale electrical systems such as power transmission and motor control. Electrical engineers are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit energy.",
